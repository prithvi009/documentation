# Form Provider Webhooks

TrackSource provides universal webhooks that work with any form provider. When a visitor submits a form, the webhook captures their information and links it to their browsing history for accurate attribution.

## How It Works

```
Visitor Journey                          TrackSource
─────────────────                        ───────────
1. Clicks Facebook Ad    ──────────────▶  Tracks UTM, fbp, fbc
2. Visits landing page   ──────────────▶  Assigns anonymous ID
3. Browses your site     ──────────────▶  Records page views
4. Submits form          ──────────────▶  Webhook receives data
5. Becomes lead          ──────────────▶  Links to journey
                                          ↓
                         Attribution complete: Facebook gets credit
```

## Universal Webhook URL

All webhooks follow this pattern:

```
https://events.tracksource.io/webhooks/{provider}/YOUR_TENANT_ID
```

Replace `{provider}` with your form provider name and `YOUR_TENANT_ID` with your Tenant ID.

## Webhook Payload

When a form is submitted, TrackSource receives a webhook payload containing:

### Standard Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `email` | Visitor's email address (required) |
| `name` | Full name or first/last name |
| `phone` | Phone number for identity resolution |
| `ts_anonymous_id` | TrackSource anonymous ID (recommended) |

### Automatic Enrichment

TrackSource automatically enriches each lead with:

- **UTM Parameters**: source, medium, campaign, content, term
- **Click IDs**: fbclid, gclid, ttclid, li_fat_id
- **Browser IDs**: fbp (Facebook), _ga (Google Analytics)
- **Referrer**: Original traffic source
- **Landing Page**: First page visited
- **Device Info**: Browser, OS, device type

## Hidden Field Setup

For best attribution accuracy, add a hidden field to your forms that captures the TrackSource anonymous ID.

### Field Configuration

| Provider | Field Name | Field Type |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Tally | `ts_anonymous_id` | Hidden |
| Typeform | `ts_anonymous_id` | Hidden |
| HubSpot | `ts_anonymous_id` | Hidden single-line text |
| Custom | `ts_anonymous_id` | `<input type="hidden">` |

### Why Hidden Fields Matter

Without the hidden field, TrackSource uses probabilistic matching (email, IP, user agent) which is ~85% accurate. With the hidden field, matching is 100% deterministic.

```
Without Hidden Field                 With Hidden Field
────────────────────                 ─────────────────
Email: john@email.com               Email: john@email.com
IP: 192.168.1.1                     Anonymous ID: anon_abc123
User Agent: Chrome/120                    ↓
       ↓                             100% Match
Probabilistic Match (~85%)
```

## Testing Webhooks

### 1. Use the Test Endpoint

Send a test payload to verify your webhook is configured correctly:

```bash
curl -X POST https://events.tracksource.io/webhooks/test/YOUR_TENANT_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "name": "Test User",
    "ts_anonymous_id": "anon_test123"
  }'
```

### 2. Check Your Dashboard

1. Go to **Analytics** → **Live Events**
2. Look for the `lead` event
3. Click on it to see the full payload and attribution data

### 3. Verify in Form Provider

Most form providers show webhook delivery status:

- **Tally**: Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → Delivery History
- **Typeform**: Connect → Webhooks → Delivery Logs
- **Calendly**: Integrations → Webhooks → Event Log

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Webhook not receiving data">
    1. Verify the webhook URL is correct (check for typos)
    2. Ensure your Tenant ID is valid
    3. Check if your form provider shows delivery errors
    4. Try the test endpoint with curl
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Lead not linked to journey">
    1. Add the `ts_anonymous_id` hidden field to your form
    2. Ensure the TrackSource script is loaded before form submission
    3. Check that the visitor has cookies enabled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate leads">
    TrackSource deduplicates leads by email within a 5-minute window. If you're seeing duplicates:
    1. Check if your form is submitting multiple times
    2. Verify you don't have multiple webhooks configured
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing attribution data">
    Attribution data comes from the visitor's browsing session. If missing:
    1. Verify the tracking script is installed on all pages
    2. Check that the form is on the same domain as the tracking script
    3. Ensure cookies are not being blocked
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
